Fractal trees and plants are among the easiest of fractal objects to
understand. They are based on the idea of self-similarity. Each of the branches is
a smaller version of the main trunk of the tree. The main idea in creating
fractal trees or plants is to have a base object and to then create smaller,
similar objects protruding from that initial object. This method is a
recursive method, meaning that it continues for each child down to a finite
number of steps.
