"""
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has
no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

The property of being prime is called primality. A simple but slow method of
verifying the primality of a given number is known as trial division. It
consists of testing whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and sqrt(n).

# The Basic

Write a program that, given a number comprised between 2 and 49, returns
if it is a prime number or not. We can assume that the computer knows
(stores) that [2, 3, 5, 7] are prime numbers.
